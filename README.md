<h3><b>Abstract:</b></h3>This project aims to build a mobile app of tourism in Canada. The mobile app is for the android OS users and the language used in building the app is Java. We have selected four key components which will act as pillars of our app namely: - Security, Accuracy, Efficiency and Responsiveness. For security, it is required that we provide 2-factor authentications.
This can be done either providing an OTP for a registered user or an email to the user which can verify the legitimacy of the user. It is also required that we encrypt the data before storing it in a
database which will add another security layer in our app. This app requires four modules namely: Registration, Login, Searching tourist spots and payment options. The app should
have an interface to see all the tourist places available in Canada and once a destination is
selected it displays the pro features of that destination. All these modules shall be loosely coupled. The backend APIs are also built using
docker containers which will help us in maintaining all the required libraries, codebase and runtime.
Docker is a major requirement for our project because by using it, we can deploy and scale our app
into any environment. We used Express JS as our backend and a NoSQL database i.e., MongoDB as it provides
faster data operations which in turn increases performance and efficiency of our tourism app.

<h3><b>Functionalities:</b></h3>The major of the application are:<br/>
Registration<br/>
Login<br/>
Searching tourist spots<br/>
Make booking<br/>
Payment options<br/>

<h3><b>Installation Process:</b></h3>1. Git clone https://github.com/uanthwal/Canada-Tourism-Mobile-App<br/>
2. Import the project in Android Studio<br/>
3. Wait for the gradle to finishing building activites<br/>
4. Run the app<br/>

<h3><b>Dependencies:</b></h3>
